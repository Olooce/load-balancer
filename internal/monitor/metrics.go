package monitor

// Importing necessary packages
// import (
// 	"github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
// )

// Since the metrics are already defined in common.go, we don't need to redefine them here.
// Just use the functions and metrics from common.go directly.

// Any other specific logic related to metrics can be handled here.
// For now, the file might remain empty as common.go has all necessary functionality.
